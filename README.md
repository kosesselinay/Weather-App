# Weather-App

This weather app is a web app where users enter city name, check API and view weather data. The user enters a city name in the search box and then clicks the search button. This click is captured by the JavaScript code and passed to the OpenWeather API as part of the specified city name API check. API restrictions pull the current weather checkers of the specified city.

The data from the API is processed by the JavaScript code and these contents are loaded into the different books of the page (example, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.). Also see when visually seen, such as background color and weather icon based on split sunrise and sunset times. So the registry and dark mode plugin are also available.

The application uses web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While HTML creates the basic structure of the page, CSS determines the design and layout. JavaScript captures user interactions, makes API calls, processes data, and updates the page dynamically.

API components are done via the fetch function. Open API key and destination URL using weather data. The incoming data is taken in JSON format and parsed with JavaScript elements. These links allow users to keep the current weather information of the place they want. This information is placed and touched by JavaScript in different parts of the page.
